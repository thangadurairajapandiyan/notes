# Helm Chart Basics
* By default, helm will not have the repos added,
  we have to add the helm official repo like this,
  ```
  helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
  ```

* In Helm chart we can define the dependency helm charts, while installing the parent helm chart the dependencies are downloaded from repos and stored in charts/ folder. We can also manually download and put the chart.tgz in charts/ folder
  * Defining the dependency helm chart in parent Charts.yaml
    ```
    # parentchart/Chart.yaml
    apiVesrion: v2
    name: parentchart
    version: 1.0.0
    dependencies:
      - name: apache
        version: 1.2.3
        repository: https://example.com/charts
      - name: mysql
        version: 3.2.1
        repository: https://another.example.com/charts
    ```
  * we can use "alias" option to rename the chart and store in /charts folder
    ```
    # parentchart/Chart.yaml
    apiVesrion: v2
    name: parentchart
    version: 1.0.0
    dependencies:
      - name: subchart
        repository: http://localhost:10191
        version: 0.1.0
        alias: new-subchart-1
      - name: subchart
        repository: http://localhost:10191
        version: 0.1.0
        alias: new-subchart-2
      - name: subchart
        repository: http://localhost:10191
        version: 0.1.0
    ```
* we can use "tags" and "condition" option to control the installation of dependency charts. 
  * condition has higher preference than tags.
  * The first condition path that exists wins and subsequent ones for that chart are ignored.
  * If the "condition" values are not defined in the values.yaml, then the defined "condition" has no effect.
  * Tags and conditions values must be set in the top parent's values.
  * The tags: key in values must be a top level key. Globals and nested tags: tables are not currently supported.
  ```
  # parentchart/Chart.yaml
  dependencies:
    - name: subchart1
      repository: http://localhost:10191
      version: 0.1.0
      condition: subchart1.enabled, global.subchart1.enabled
      tags:
        - front-end
        - subchart1
    - name: subchart2
      repository: http://localhost:10191
      version: 0.1.0
      condition: subchart2.enabled,global.subchart2.enabled
      tags:
        - back-end
        - subchart2
  ```
  ```
  # parentchart/values.yaml

  subchart2:
    enabled: true
  tags:
    front-end: false
    back-end: true
  ```
* The --set parameter can be used as usual to alter tag and condition values.
  ```
  helm install --set tags.front-end=true --set subchart2.enabled=false
  ```
* we can get/import the valuse from child values.yaml to parent values.yaml. If the child values are alreday present in parent values.yaml, it will be overwriitrn in parent values.yaml https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#chart-dependencies
* Helm creates kubernetes resources in the following order and uninstall its in reverse order,
  ```
  "Namespace",
  "NetworkPolicy",
  "ResourceQuota",
  "LimitRange",
  "PodSecurityPolicy",
  "PodDisruptionBudget",
  "Secret",
  "ConfigMap",
  "StorageClass",
  "PersistentVolume",
  "PersistentVolumeClaim",
  "ServiceAccount",
  "CustomResourceDefinition",
  "ClusterRole",
  "ClusterRoleList",
  "ClusterRoleBinding",
  "ClusterRoleBindingList",
  "Role",
  "RoleList",
  "RoleBinding",
  "RoleBindingList",
  "Service",
  "DaemonSet",
  "Pod",
  "ReplicationController",
  "ReplicaSet",
  "Deployment",
  "HorizontalPodAutoscaler",
  "StatefulSet",
  "Job",
  "CronJob",
  "Ingress",
  "APIService"
  ```
* The chart can be deprecated by specifying the "deprecated: true" in Charts.yaml
* Predefined Values
  * Release.Name: The name of the release (not the chart)
  * Release.Namespace: The namespace the chart was released to.
  * Release.Service: The service that conducted the release.
  * Release.IsUpgrade: This is set to true if the current operation is an upgrade or rollback.
  * Release.IsInstall: This is set to true if the current operation is an install.
  * Chart: The contents of the Chart.yaml. Thus, the chart version is obtainable as Chart.Version and the maintainers are in Chart.Maintainers.
* "global" is a special variable to pass the values to dependency charts. 
  * By default dependency chart cannot read values from parent root values
  * we can pass valuses to dependency charts from parent values.yaml
  ```
  title: "My WordPress Site" # Sent to the WordPress template
  
  global:
    app: MyWordPress

  mysql: # Dependency chart name
    max_connections: 100 # Sent to MySQL
    password: "secret"

  apache: # Dependency chart name
    port: 8080 # Passed to Apache  
  ```
* The schema file "values.schema.json" in chart root folder is used the enforce the chart values, define a structure, make some valuse as required value (eg.       string type for specific value in values.yaml)
  ```
  {
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
    "properties": {
      "image": {
        "description": "Container Image",
        "properties": {
          "repo": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "tag": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "type": "object"
      },
      "name": {
        "description": "Service name",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "port": {
        "description": "Port",
        "minimum": 0,
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "protocol": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "protocol",
      "port"
    ],
    "title": "Values",
    "type": "object"
  }
  ```
* "template directives" or templating feature not avilable for CRD yaml files defined in crds/ folder
  ```
  kind: CustomResourceDefinition
  metadata:
    name: crontabs.stable.example.com
  spec:
    group: stable.example.com
    versions:
      - name: v1
        served: true
        storage: true
    scope: Namespaced
    names:
      plural: crontabs
      singular: crontab
      kind: CronTab
  ```
* Limitations on CRDs
  * Unlike most objects in Kubernetes, CRDs are installed globally. For that reason, Helm takes a very cautious approach in managing CRDs. CRDs are subject to the     following limitations:

  * CRDs are never reinstalled. If Helm determines that the CRDs in the crds/ directory are already present (regardless of version), Helm will not attempt to         install or upgrade.
  * CRDs are never installed on upgrade or rollback. Helm will only create CRDs on installation operations.
    CRDs are never deleted. Deleting a CRD automatically deletes all of the CRD's contents across all namespaces in the cluster. Consequently, Helm will not           delete CRDs.
* Chart Repositories
  A repository is characterized primarily by the presence of a special file called index.yaml that has a list of all of the packages supplied by the repository,     together with metadata that allows retrieving and verifying those packages.
