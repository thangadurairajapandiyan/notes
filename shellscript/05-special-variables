1	$0 --> The filename of the current script.

2	$n --> These variables correspond to the arguments with which a script was invoked. Here n is a positive decimal number corresponding to the position of an
argument (the first argument is $1, the second argument is $2, and so on).

3	$# --> The number of arguments supplied to a script.

4	$* --> All the arguments are double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $* is equivalent to $1 $2.

5	$@ --> All the arguments are individually double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $@ is equivalent to $1 $2.

6	$? --> The exit status of the last command executed.

7	$$ --> The process number of the current shell. For shell scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing.

8	$! --> The process number of the last background command.
